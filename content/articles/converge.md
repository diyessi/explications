# Convergence

It's common to think of the real numbers as all the different decimal numbers, such as 1.242 and 13962.14702, as well as non-terminating values. Then the rational numbers are treated as a subset of the real numbers, the integers a subset of the rational numbers, and the non-negative integers as a subset of the integers. Are we sure that there is some decimal representation for every real number? You may know that .9999... is 1, even though they look quite different. Mathematicians were asking these same questions more than a century ago when they started to find inconsistencies in what seemed like the natural way to think about numbers. Here we will look at how the numbers were redefined to avoid those inconsistencies, in some cases leading to other more esoteric results that don't feel right.
